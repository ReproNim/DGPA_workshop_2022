# Reproducible Neuroimaging - a ReproNim workshop 

## "What's in this repository?"

This repository contains the basic skeleton for workshop, as well as most of the utilzied materials, including slides and jupyter notebooks.

We've tried to document the various aspects  with a whole bunch of README files, so feel free to jump around and check things out.

The general idea was to generate one overarching and interactive resource, allowing attendees and other interested folks to follow the slides and play
around with the various tutorials and go through things in their own pace, potentially before and after the workshop. 
Overall, the content is divided into three sections:

- [Outline, Overview, Setup and general questions]()
- [Prerequisites]() 
- [Feedback]()

For everything else and specific information regarding the sections, please consult the [rendered jupyter book]().

## "I have some questions..."

[Open an issue]() on this repository and someone will try and get back to you as soon as possible!
