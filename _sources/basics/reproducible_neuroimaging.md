# Reproducible Neuroimaging - an introduction

As we just heard and most of you already experienced: it's all bad and `reproducibility` in basically all research fields rather absent or drastically limited, with `neuroimaging` being no exception... .  However, what are the causes of this suboptimal phenomenon? What are common pitfalls and what are potential solutions going forward?

Before we start exploring `tools` & `resources` that allow us to tackle the respective problems and make `neuroimaging` more `reproducible`, we will spend some time learning about and discussing the theoretical background, as well as important implications. 

## Content 💡👩🏽‍🏫  

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session. Contrary to most other sessions, there will be no practical hands-on part but we strongly support and encourage discussions.

#### Objectives 📍
- Learn about underlying causes of limited `reproducibility`
- Get to know implications of this shortcoming

#### Materials 📓
