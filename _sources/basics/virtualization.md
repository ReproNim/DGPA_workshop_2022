# Virtualization of computing environments

We all know the problem: we want to run or re-run an analysis but basically nothing works... . Trying to solve installation issues creates more problems than it solves, software dependencies are not compatible, the analyses need a certain `OS` and chances are high that even if things run, results vary throughout machines. And the "worst part": your colleagues/collaborators just say the following.

The harsh truth is that `computing environments` are one of the major aspects one needs to address regarding `reproducibility`, also in `neuroimaging`. This refers to the `computational architecture` one is using, including the respective `software stack` and `versions` thereof. But what can be done here? Sending `machines` around via post? Rather not... However, there's a process with accompanying resources and tools that is a staple in other research fields since a while but is now also more and more utilized within `neuroimaging`: `virtualization of computing environments`. Within this 2 h session of the workshop, we will explore the underlying problems, rationales and basics, as well as provide first hands-on experience. 

## Content üí°üë©üèΩ‚Äçüè´  

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session. Specifically, we will get to know `virtualization` based on a real-world example, i.e. a small `python script` that used [DIPY]() to perform a set of `DTI analyses`. The main content and information will be provided as `slides` but there will also be some `scripts`. Thus, please check the `materials` section carefully. This also means will have a split between presenting `slides` and running things in the `terminal`.    

#### Objectives üìç
- Learn about open and reproducible methods and how to apply them using `conda` and `Docker` (or `Singularity`)
- Know the differences between `virtualization techniques`
- Familiarize yourself with the `virtualization`/`container` ecosystem for scientific work
- Empower you with tools and technologies to do `reproducible`, `scalable` and `efficient` research


#### Materials üìì

As mentioned above, we will have a set of different materials for this `session`, including `slides` and `scripts`. The `slides` include the background information, as well as most of the `commands` we will run in the `terminal` during the session. You can find them here or can directly [download](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13Wq8LFcnRaLWkRRsVnbP_-CuZKdVMTqnVT9AZ3JGAH0/present?usp=sharing) them:

The `scripts` entail a `python script` called `fancy_DTI_analyses.py` which will be the example on which we will explore `virtualization` and `virtualization_commands.sh` which is a `bash script` that contains all `commands` we are going to run during the session so that you can easily copy-paste them/have them on file in case you missed something. You can find them in the [GitHub repository of this workshop](https://github.com/ReproNim/DGPA_workshop_2022/tree/main/workshop/basics/scripts_virtualization) or download them below:

[fancy_DTI_analyses.py]()

[virtualization_commands.sh]()

Please make sure to get them on way or the other and place them on your `Desktop` for easy access. Also, you might want to download the `Docker image` we are going to `build` during the session in advance to have it ready to go. You can find it below:

[![Docker image](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/peerherholz/millennium_falcon)](https://hub.docker.com/r/peerherholz/millennium_falcon)

and download it via:

```
docker pull peerherholz/millennium_falcon:v0.0.1
```

### Questions you should be able to answer based on this lecture üñ•Ô∏è‚úçüèΩüìñ

:::{admonition} What is `virtualization` and why is it important/helpful?
:class: tip, dropdown
`Virtualization` refers to the process of encapsulating `computing environments` in a way that they can be shared and utilized on different machines. Depending on the `virtualization` type and problem at hand, it can help a great deal with software/computing management and reproducibility as common issues like installation problems, software dependencies and sustainability can be efficiently tackled.

:::{admonition} What types of `virtualization` do exist?
:class: tip, dropdown
There are `three main levels` of `virtualization` as summarized below:

### optional reading/further materials

There are a lot of fantastic resources out there to further familiarize yourself with `virtualization`, no matter of dedicated `workshops`, `videos` or what have you. Below, we just compiled a small list of other `introductory level` resources through which you can continue to explore this amazing approach to data management & analyses.
