# A reproducible neuroimaging workflow

Being the last session of this workshop, we have a lot to look back to and think about. Especially if you're rather unfamiliar with the aspects, tools and resources discussed during the last two days it can be very overwhelming and actually not that helpful...we all know the feeling displayed below:

Thus, we thought about having a short session within which we show where and how the things we explore together can be integrated in your research workflow. Additionally, we will also talk about their integration and show adjacent things, we unfortunately didn't had the time to discuss.  

## Content 💡👩🏽‍🏫  

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session. Given the content and time restrictions there will only be a `slide` deck for now but we hope that this session will directly lead to a lengthy and in-depth Q&A and discussion. 

#### Objectives 📍
- Situate & integrate the discussed aspects, tools & resources along the `research workflow`
- Learn about adjacent aspects, tools & resources

#### Materials 📓

You can find the `slides` here or can directly [download](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pWEohV97CLfvfzO7dhBs3SA7N6kQCRaGHRrURx3tlw8/present?usp=sharing) them:
