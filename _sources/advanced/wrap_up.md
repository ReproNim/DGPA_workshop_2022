# Wrap up, discussion & Q&A

We've reached the end of our workshop and thus time together, at least for now. In the last part, we would like to briefly recap the things we've talked about and then provide the opportunity for a lengthy Q&A and discussion to answer all of your questions, as well as get to know you, your thoughts on all this and your research a bit more. Thus, please don't hold back with questions, feedback and things you would like to bring up! 

## Content 💡👩🏽‍🏫
