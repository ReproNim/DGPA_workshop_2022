# Course add-ons 

## Let there be post-workshop training

Following the statements above, we additionally compiled a list of hopefully helpful resources concerning `python` and specially `neuroimaging analyses` in `python`. Importantly, **these are not course pre-requisites** but meant to provide you with some ideas of what's possible in `python` with comparably few lines of code that are also very intelligible. Please note that this list will be constantly extended. As other parts of the content, they are [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) that can be run interactively (via the little rocket on the top right) or locally (via the download button on the top right) and mix theoretical background with actual code so that folks can familiarize themselves with the corresponding topics.

We can't stress this enough: it's all ok, don't let the imposter syndrome get the better of you.
