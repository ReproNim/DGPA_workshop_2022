# Workshop overview

As mentioned on the [Welcome page](https://repronim.github.io/dgpa_workshop/index.html), this workshop will be focused on `reproducible neuroimaging` and cover various important aspects from an introduction to the problem and motivation to adapt neuroimaging reesarch workflows accordingly to the utilization of basic and advanced tools/resources. In general, the idea is to do a split between first, the basics of `reproducible neuroimaging` and second, more advanced and specialized approaches. Regarding the first, we will try to provide folks with a brief overview of central aspects, as well as important issues and concerning the second, evaluate and introduce a versatile set of cutting-edge approaches that build upon the former. Within both, we will go through and practice the use of respective software, tools and resources. We will further explain both aspects, as well as the `setup`, etc. below. For a precise outline of this workshop, please consult the respective [page](https://repronim.github.io/dgpa_workshop/outline.html). 


## The framework and setup

All workshop materials will be provided within the [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) format you're currently looking at, free for everyone to check and try out, as well as utilize further. The workshop itself will use a mixture of slides, code and other media within presentations, practical hands-on sessions and discussion rounds to enable a holistic introduction paired with firsthand experience. Depending on a given participant's computational resources and infrastructure, we provide multiple ways to participate in the workshop as outlined in the [Setup for the workshop](https://repronim.github.io/dgpa_workshop/setup.html) section.
