# Standardization in neuroimaging

Imagine the following two scenarios... (1) You ask the author of a paper you would like to re-analyse the data of and actually find it/get it without the usual "Sorry, can't find it anymore." or "This is not a reasonable request." nonsense. However, upon starting the inspect the data, nothing makes sense. There are strange directories and naming patterns, no basic/in-depth information about files and the content thereof, proprietary formats, etc., thus, basically no option to understand what's going and re-use the data appropriately. (2) A colleague shares a dataset with you, as you plan to conduct distinct yet complimentary analyses. Unfortunately, instead of just starting to analyse, you have to spent a week asking your colleague about details of the dataset in order to understand it, resulting in a loss of resources for the both of you. 
Sounds familiar? Yeah, we all have been there and the reason we encounter this prominent problem of un[FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) data is the lack of `standardization` and `meta-data` enrichment.

So, what now? Should we just keep going and either don't ever (re-)use data efficiently or spending weeks trying to understand a shared dataset? Hard no to both! There are several amazing initiatives concerning the `standardization` and `meta-data` enrichment of data to increase `FAIR`ness. Within the realm of `neuroimaging`, you might have heard about the fantastic [Brain Imaging Data Structure](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) or `BIDS` for short. It's a community-based and -driven initiative to describe a broad range and various types of data in a simple and easy to adopt manner. Comprising a [specification](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [ecosystem](https://github.com/bids-standard), `BIDS` is continuously evolving and expanding since its introduction in 2015/2016. Within this session we will explore the rationale and motivation behind it, what it entails exactly, its community and organization, as well as how you can utilize this amazing effort!  

## Content 💡👩🏽‍🏫  

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session. Beside a `slide` deck, there will also be practical hands-on aspects, showcasing `BIDS` on an `MEG` dataset with pointers to other modalities such as `MRI` being provided.

#### Objectives 📍
- Learn about the importance of `standardization` and `meta-data` enrichment 
- Get to know `BIDS` and its components
- Obtain first practical experience working with `BIDS` datasets

#### Materials 📓
