# Social & networking

After all this rather "serious" time, we thought it would be nice to hang out in a different capacity and have a social with everyone interested. As the last two years showed us: this can be hard to come by virtually. However, there are some cool things out there to get the best of the virtual social experience. One of them is [gathertown](https://app.gather.town/signin) which allows you to walk around and interact using avatars. It's fun and interactive!

To join please do the following:
`Click on the link shared via zoom` -> `create your avatar` -> `meet everyone at the main entrance`.
