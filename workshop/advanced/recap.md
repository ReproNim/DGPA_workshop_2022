Thus, it might be a good idea to briefly recap the things we talked about during day 1 and situate them within the `research workflow`. This is also your chance to ask questions and follow up on things that remained unclear. Thus, please don't hold back: we want to support everyone as much as possible!

## Content 💡👩🏽‍🏫  

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session. As it will contain a brief recap, we will only have a short `slide` deck and will re-visit materials from day 1 as needed.
