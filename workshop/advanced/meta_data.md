### Questions you should be able to answer based on this lecture 🖥️✍🏽📖

:::{admonition} What is the purpose of data dictionaries
:class: tip, dropdown
To provide human readable explanations and definitions for variables and values
in your data, such as text based phenotypic data tables.
This can include units for numeric data or 
definitions for (abbreviated) levels of categorical data.
:::

:::{admonition} Why are data dictionaries not enough
:class: tip, dropdown
Because terms and definitions can be ambiguous. For unambigous definitions
of variables and values, we need to use terms from taxonomies or controlled 
vocabularies. Developing a new controlled vocabulary is a complex process
that requires input from experts in the community to achieve broad agreement
on the terms.
:::

:::{admonition} Why should metadata be machine readable
:class: tip, dropdown
So we can provide services that can integrate large amounts of structured
meta data across datasets automatically such as dataset search, 
cohort definition, and provenance tracking.
