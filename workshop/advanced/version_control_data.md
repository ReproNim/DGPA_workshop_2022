# Version control - data

## Content 💡👩🏽‍🏫  

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session.

### Motivation 
[Research Data Management](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm.html) is a core component of good scientific practice and can help to make your work not only more reproducible and transparent but also easier, and version control for data can be one component of it.
This session introduces [DataLad](https://datalad.org), a data management and data publication tool building up on version control systems.

If you answer "yes" to any of the following questions, this session will be interesting for you:

Have you ever worked through such a directory?

Is this metaphor fitting to a paper of yours?

Have you ever looked like this trying to figure out how a colleagues script is supposed to work (or an old script of yourself)?

Do you find yourself wondering how to share or publish the data and results of your recent project?

#### Objectives 📍
- Understand why we should not only version control code and other small files, but also data or software
- Understand the advantages of distributed version control for data
- Get first-hand usage experience with DataLad, and master the following DataLad concepts:
    - Create and consume datasets
    - Perform version control on arbitrarily sized digital objects
    - Link components of a data analysis (code, data, software) together
    - Run and rerun computationally reproducible data analyses

#### Materials 📓



You can find the `slides` [here](https://github.com/datalad-handbook/course) or you can directly [download](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6364571) them from Zenodo.
