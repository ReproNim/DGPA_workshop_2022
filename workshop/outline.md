# Outline
The [overview]() already specified it, but just to be sure: the workshop will be split into two distinct parts. While the first half (and few hours) will consist of going through `basics in reproducible neuroimaging`, the second half 
will entail examples of dedicated `advanced concepts` within which folks will also evaluate the discussed topics. As mentioned before, these resources will contain all materials utilized in the workshop.

### When and where do we meet?

As mentioned in the [overview]() section, the course will take place on two afternoons: Tuesday, 22/03/2002 & Wednesday, 23/03/2022, from 1 - 6 PM CET. Given the current situation re the pandemic and the international line-up of instructors, the entire workshop will be run via [Zoom]() and in parts [Gathertown](). The respective links will be provided for registered participants shortly before the workshop.

### Schedule
In general, we will aim for 5 h per session. The content of the respective sessions will span everything from `interactive lectures` to `hands-on tutorials` and will mostly entail a mixture of the two. The different parts are roughly indicated in the schedule below like this:

💡 - input from the instructor(s)   
👩🏽‍🏫 - instructor(s) presents content    
👨🏻‍💻🧑🏾‍💻 - hands-on computational work (e.g., coding)      
  

Our **very optimistic** schedule looks as follows (all times in CET):
