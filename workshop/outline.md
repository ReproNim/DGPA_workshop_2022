# Outline

The [overview]() already specified it, but just to be sure: the workshop will be split into two distinct parts. While the first half (and few hours) will consist of going through `basics in reproducible neuroimaging`, the second half 
will entail examples of dedicated `advanced concepts` within which folks will also evaluate the discussed topics. As mentioned before, these resources will contain all materials utilized in the workshop. In general, we will aim for 5 h per session. Our **very optimistic** schedule looks as follows (all times in CET): 

## Session 1 -
