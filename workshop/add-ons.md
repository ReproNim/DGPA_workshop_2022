# Course add-ons 


## Ain't no workshop good enough
The reality of workshops like these is that they really don't teach attending folks all they need to know to subsequently apply the respective content sufficiently, not to mention the training aspect. At best, workshops provide folks with the materials, overview and pointers necessary to continue and actually dive into the taught topics (the truth hurts sometimes, doesn't it?). Another important aspect that is frequently overlooked is that attendees usually need a certain set of skills and experience to really benefit from a given workshop, especially considering the diverse backgrounds folks have. We want to be fair, open and welcoming to everyone and while we know that we unfortunately can't achieve and assume a truly similar level of training and experience across all participants, we can at least do our best to work towards certain opportunities. That being said, workshops like the one you're currently looking at, by default (should) require basic to advanced programming skills and knowledge about file handling/input/output (and depending on the precise outline also signal processing, statistics and linear algebra (vectors much?)). Tough stuff, eh?

## Let there be post-workshop training

Following the statements above, we additionally compiled a list of hopefully helpful resources concerning `python` and specially `neuroimaging analyses` in `python`. Importantly, **these are not course pre-requisites** but meant to provide you with some ideas of what's possible in `python` with comparably few lines of code that are also very intelligible. Please note that this list will be constantly extended. As other parts of the content, they are [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) that can be run interactively (via the little rocket on the top right) or locally (via the download button on the top right) and mix theoretical background with actual code so that folks can familiarize themselves with the corresponding topics.

We can't stress this enough: it's all ok, don't let the imposter syndrome get the better of you.
